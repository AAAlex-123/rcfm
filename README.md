# RCFM: The Reddit Custom Feed Manager
RCFM, an acronym for "Reddit Custom Feed Manager", is a python command-line utility, which allows for easy management of custom feeds. Adding and removing subreddits to and from a custom feed is [really slow](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/ye24mn/how_to_add_communities_in_custom_feeds/). This utility makes it easy to see at a glance the user's custom feeds and the subreddits each of them aggregates, and enables them to make changes simply by editing a plain text file.

This project is still in its very early prototyping stages, many more features can be expected to come. Any suggestions are welcomed!
